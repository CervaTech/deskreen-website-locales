<h2>Notes on editing `translation.json` files. (Applies to all contributors wether you know how to code or not)</h2>
</a>

When editing a `translation.json` file, don't change the **left part of translation** before the `:`.
Only change the text between `"` on right side of `:` sign.

#### Example:

Some content of `translation.json`

<a id="edit-orig">
<h6>Before your change (original):</h6>
</a>

```
...
"Hello": "Hello"
...
```

##### Good example, after your change (for example Spanish language support):

```
...
"Hello": "Hola"
...
```

##### **Bad example** of your change (left side is different than in [original](#edit-orig)):

```
...
"Greetings": "Hola"
...
```

### Rule of thumb, don't edit a text on a left side of `:` sign in `translation.json` file. only edit a text between `"` on the right side from `:` symbol.

<h2>When adding a new language important notes (Applies to all contributors wether you know how to code or not)</h2>
</a>

* use `en/translation.json` as a template.
* dont miss this part at the top of the file:
   ```
    "language name": "English",
    "language": "language",
    "language flag": "üá∫üá∏",
   ```
   * the `language name` is how the language calls itself. For example Russian -> –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π . So this should be: `"language": "–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π"` in russian
   * `language flag` is emoji country flag where this language is the most widespread. You can search for country flag emojis here: [https://getemoji.com/](https://getemoji.com/) , then copy-paste emoji symbol. Example for ukrainian language this line should be: `"language flag": "üá∫üá¶"`
   * `"language": "language"` is how the word `language` translated to your target language. Example of how this look in spanish: `"language": "idioma"`
* [Follow these general guides on editing `translation.json`](#notes-on-edit)
